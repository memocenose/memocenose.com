# This is a very big post titlle
## introduction

Once upon a time, there was a guy trying to create a website.

It was not the easiest task, but as he was a little by tech savvy, and command line lover for many years, he decided to give a go with *Jamstack* concept. 

Therefore he installed hugo. To get comfortable, he decided to play with it, and become more and more confident with all those underlying concepts. 

Indeed what are you currently reading right now, is just results of all those funny plays he had with *hugo* and *jamstack*. 

Have fun.
